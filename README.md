► The AQ monitoring system is designed to be used by people to improve their health and to protect the nature, the environment. 
► It can provide real time information on air quality levels and weather conditions. AQ 
► The portable module is powered by a rechargeable battery, that uses solar power


● In conclusion, my project aimed to explore the effectiveness of a portable and solar-powered measuring module for monitoring air quality. Based on experimental results, I discovered that the device was effective in measuring air pollutants in both indoor and outdoor.

● AQ project also has the potential for future exploration, including expanding the module's capabilities to measure additional air pollutants and exploring ways to make the module more cost-effective.
